                <p>Computers connected to the<span class="blue"> Web</span> are called <span class="wieth">clients</span> and <span class="wieth">servers</span>.
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="blue">Clients </span>are the typical Web user's Internet-connected devices (for example, your computer connected to your Wi-Fi, or your phone connected to your mobile network) and <span class="blue">Web-accessing software </span>available
                            on those devices (usually a web browser like Firefox or Chrome).</li>
                        <li><span class="blue">Servers </span>are computers that store <span class="blue">webpages</span>, <span class="blue">sites</span>, or <span class="blue">apps</span>. When a client device wants to access a webpage, a copy of the webpage
                            is downloaded from the server onto the client machine to be displayed in the user's web browser.</li>
                    </ul>

                <p class="head">So What Actually Happens?</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The browser goes to the <span class="blue">DNS server</span> and finds the real address of the <span class="blue">server </span>that the website lives on.</li>
                    <li>The browser sends an<span class="blue"> HTTP</span> request message to the server asking it to send a copy of the website to the client.</li>
                    <li> If the server approves the client's request, the server sends the client a <span class="blue">"200 OK" message</span>, which means "Permission granted! Here you go!", and then starts sending the website's files to the browser as a
                        series of small chunks.</li>
                    <li>The browser assembles the small chunks into a complete website and displays it to you! </li>
